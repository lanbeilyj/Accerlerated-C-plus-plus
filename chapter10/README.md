#Exercises

10-0. Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

10-1. Rewrite the student-grading program from §9.6/166 to generate letter grades.

10-2. Rewrite the median function from §8.1.1/140 so that we can call it with either a vector or a built-in array. The function should allow containers of any arithmetic type.

10-3. Write a test program to verify that the median function operates correctly. Ensure that calling median does not change the order of the elements in the container.

10-4. Write a class that implements a list that holds strings.

10-5. Write a bidirectional iterator for your String_list class.

10-6. Test the class by rewriting the split function to put its output into a String_list.
