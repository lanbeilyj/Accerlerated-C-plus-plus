#Exercises

6-0. Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

6-1. Reimplement the frame and hcat operations from §5.8.1/93 and §5.8.3/94 to use iterators.

6-2. Write a program to test the find_urls function.

6-3. What does this program fragment do?
```
vector<int> u(10, 100);
vector<int> v;
copy(u.begin(), u.end(), v.begin());
```
Write a program that contains this fragment, and compile and execute it.

6-4. Correct the program you wrote in the previous exercise to copy from u into v. There are at least two possible ways to correct the program. Implement both, and describe the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

6-5. Write an analysis function to call optimistic_median.

6-6. Note that the function from the previous exercise and the functions from §6.2.2/113 and §6.2.3/115 do the same task. Merge these three analysis functions into a single function.

6-7. The portion of the grading analysis program from §6.2.1/110 that read and classified student records depending on whether they did (or did not) do all the homework is similar to the problem we solved in extract_fails. Write a function to handle this subproblem.

6-8. Write a single function that can be used to classify students based on criteria of your choice. Test this function by using it in place of the extract_fails program, and use it in the program to analyze student grades.

6-9. Use a library algorithm to concatenate all the elements of a vector<string>.
